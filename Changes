Revision history for Perl module ShiftJIS::String.

0.15  Sun Dec 30 10:24:36 2001
    - bug fix (XS): when toupper, tolower, strrev got a numeral
      (i.e. not a string), the program had been crashed!

0.14  Wed Dec 26 20:52:17 2001
    - Don't call strtr_light() by yourself! (XS version)
      But now checks TABLE briefly and croaks if weird.

0.13  Wed Dec 26 01:36:34 2001
    - performance of strtr() and trclosure() in XS is improved.

0.12  Mon Dec 24 17:57:11 2001
    - strtr() and trclosure() use XS when task is simpler,
      i.e. both SEARCHLIST and REPLACEMENTLIST are strings (not an arrayref),
       and neither PATTERN nor TOPATTERN are specified.
      ('n' modifier enforces to use the Non-XS subroutine.)
    - amplify tests and documents a bit.

0.11  Sun Dec 23 12:20:47 2001
    - an XS version and a Non-XS version are in the package.
    - reverse character ranges without confirmation (by a true 2nd argument
      for mkrange() or 'r' modifier for trclosure(), strtr()) are croaked.

0.09  Sun Sep 02 22:08:15 2001
