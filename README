ShiftJIS::String: version 1.02
==============

NAME

ShiftJIS::String - functions to manipulate Shift-JIS strings

SYNOPSIS

  use ShiftJIS::String qw(length substr index rindex);

  $str = 'プログラミング-Perl';
  $sub = substr($str, index($str, 'ラミ') + length('ラミ'));

   # $sub eq 'ング-Perl'.
   # If you want to use core functions after importing,
   # prefix the core function name with 'CORE::', like CORE::length.

DESCRIPTION

This module provides some functions which emulate
the corresponding CORE functions and will help someone
to manipulate Shift-JIS string.

* Functions other than length(), substr(), index(), and rindex()
will have different names from those of the corresponding CORE:: functions.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you have a C compiler and want to use XSUB edition,
type the following (!! "enableXS" must run before "Makefile.PL" !!):

   perl enableXS
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you decide to install pure Perl (i.e. non-XS) edition after trying
to build XSUB, type the following:

   make clean
   perl disableXS
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

PREREQUISITES

   Perl 5.003 or later for pure Perl edition
   (Perl 5.005 or later Recommended.)

   Perl 5.6 or later for XSUB edition.

POD

The documents for this module are written in Shift-JIS.
(The explanations are given in English in String.pod,
but some sample codes include Shift-JIS literals.)
The CPAN Archiver should make it unreadable.

The HTML-ized PODs are provided in my website.
