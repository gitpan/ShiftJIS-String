NAME

ShiftJIS::String - functions to manipulate Shift_JIS encoded strings

SYNOPSIS

  use ShiftJIS::String qw(substr index length);
  $str = 'プログラミング Perl';
  $len = length(substr($str, 2 + index($str, 'ラミ')));
   # $len == 7, length in characters of 'ング Perl'.
   # CORE::length should be used to get length in bytes.

DESCRIPTION

the corresponding CORE functions and helps someone
to manipulate multiple-byte character sequences in Shift_JIS encoding.
