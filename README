NAME

ShiftJIS::String - functions to manipulate Shift_JIS encoded strings

SYNOPSIS

  use ShiftJIS::String qw(length substr index rindex);

  $str = 'プログラミング-Perl';
  $sub = substr($str, index($str, 'ラミ') + length('ラミ'));

   # $sub eq 'ング-Perl'.
   # If you want to use byte-oriented functions after importing,
   # prefix the core function name with 'CORE::', like CORE::length.

DESCRIPTION

the corresponding CORE functions and will help someone
to manipulate multiple-byte character sequences in Shift_JIS encoding.
