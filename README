ShiftJIS::String: version 1.00
==============

NAME

ShiftJIS::String - functions to manipulate Shift_JIS strings

SYNOPSIS

  use ShiftJIS::String qw(length substr index rindex);

  $str = 'プログラミング-Perl';
  $sub = substr($str, index($str, 'ラミ') + length('ラミ'));

   # $sub eq 'ング-Perl'.
   # If you want to use byte-oriented functions after importing,
   # prefix the core function name with 'CORE::', like CORE::length.

DESCRIPTION

This module provides some functions which emulate
the corresponding CORE functions and will help someone
to manipulate multiple-byte character sequences in Shift_JIS.

* Functions other than length(), substr(), index(), rindex()
should have different names from those
of the corresponding CORE:: functions.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you have a C compiler and want to use the XS version,
type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL xs
   make
   make test
   make install

If you decide to install the NoXS version after trying to build the XS,
type the following:

   make clean
   perl Makefile.PL noxs
   make
   make test
   make install

PREREQUISITES

   Perl 5.003 or later (Non-XS version).
   Perl 5.6 or later (XS version).

POD

The documents for this module are written in Shift_JIS.
(The explanations are given in English in String.pod,
but some sample codes include Shift_JIS literals.)
The CPAN Archiver should make it unreadable.

The HTML-ized PODs are provided in my website.
